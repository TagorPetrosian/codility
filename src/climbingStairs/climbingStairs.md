# Climbing Stairs

## Problem Description
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### Example 1: 

### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 45

## Approach
This is a classic dynamic programming problem that can also be solved using the Fibonacci sequence, as each step's solution depends on the solutions of the previous two steps.
