1. change shift/unshift to pop/push because the concept is the same but the stack is mentally reversed. but unshift/shift is more expensive operation
2. to make code more readable I can dispose of second if else;
3. find the memory print on function definition
```js
  const isValid = function() {

  }

  // vs

  function isValid() {
    
  }
```
